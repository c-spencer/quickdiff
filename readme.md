# quickdiff

quickdiff is a tool for partially updating a live DOM to match a new DOM. It was designed for providing live previews for markdown without redrawing the entire preview each time, and coping with possible transformations that have been applied to the live DOM.

# Development is now occuring in the <https://github.com/fivesixty/quickdiff> repo
